# Engineering interviews

This repository contains interview guidelines, questions, and resources for technical interviews.

> **📦 Coding Challenges Moved**: The coding challenges have been moved to a separate repository for better organization.  
> Visit **[mbianchidev/coding-challenges](https://github.com/mbianchidev/coding-challenges)** for access to all coding exercises and challenges.

This readme file contains the guidelines I follow when I interview candidates for an Engineering role and part of my question pool, mixed with questions I got asked during interviews.

I have been a hiring manager for some time but I've also applied and got interviews for many companies (100+) - including AWS, Microsoft, Google, Uber, Booking.com and ClickHouse. 

_Note: for the sake of transparency I didn't got a job offer from these (yet) but with some I passed some of their coding and system interviews alike_ 

My idea for this repo is, since I have seen and experienced first hand a lot of different approaches to the interview process, I want to provide some guideline for people to follow and maybe even spar with someone, or with me - for a (relatively) small fee.

The following list is a collection of unsorted questions that purposefully have no answers. 

The rationale is to use this as a reference for your own interview process (as candidate or as hiring manager) and to prepare for it.

Contributions to this code base are welcome but subject to my sole judgement for inclusion or exclusion, feel free to fork.

# Useful resources

There are awesome books and resources out there, I won't have an extensive list but here are some:

# STAR Method

The STAR method
S.T.A.R. is a useful acronym and an effective formula for structuring your interview responses for tech companies.

- **Situation** (20%), explain the situation so that your interviewer understands the context of your example, they do not need to know every technical detail.
- **Task** (10%), talk about the task that you took responsibility for completing or the goal of your efforts.
- **Action** (60%), describe the actions that you personally took to complete the task or reach the end goal. Highlight skills or character traits addressed in the question. Use a lot of "I" instead of "we".
- **Result** (10%), explain the positive outcomes or results generated by your actions or efforts. Here, it is important to highlight quantifiable results. You may also want to emphasize what you learned from the experience or your key takeaways. This can even be a not-so-pleasant experience, in that case still try to focus on positive takeaways.
