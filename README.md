# Interview approach

This are guidelines I follow when I interview candidates for an Engineering role.
I have been interviewed by many companies (100+) and I have been a hiring manager for some time, I have seen and experienced first hand a lot of different approaches to the interview process.

This is a collection of unsorted questions that purposefully have no answers. 
The idea is to use this as a reference for your own interview process and to prepare for it.

# STAR Method

The STAR method
S.T.A.R. is a useful acronym and an effective formula for structuring your interview responses for tech companies.

- Situation (20%), explain the situation so that your interviewer understands the context of your example, they do not need to know every technical detail.
- Task (10%), talk about the task that you took responsibility for completing or the goal of your efforts.
- Action (60%), describe the actions that you personally took to complete the task or reach the end goal. Highlight skills or character traits addressed in the question. Use "I" instead of "we".
- Result (10%), explain the positive outcomes or results generated by your actions or efforts. Here, it is important to highlight quantifiable results. You may also want to emphasize what you learned from the experience or your key takeaways. This can even be a not-so-pleasant experience, in that case still try to focus on positive takeaways.
