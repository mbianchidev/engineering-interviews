Exercise 4
The name of the program is distance.py.

Define a function square(N) that accepts as a parameter the number of times (N) and returns the average distance between two points in that square.

Analysis of the problem
It always generates two random points: so two random
x values and two random
y values and calculate the distance between the points

Repeat the operation a large number of times and keep track of the total distance in a separate variable.

Calculate the average distance by dividing the total distance by N.
