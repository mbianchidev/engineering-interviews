Uber Business Phone Screen
Our first technical interview is a 1-hour live coding interview with one of the Software Engineers from the team. 

During the interview, you can expect to:
Discuss your experience
Discuss position details
Coding exercise
How to succeed in the Business Phone Screen?
Coding:
Clarify requirements
Don't make assumptions silently - talk through them
Solve a problem better than the brute-force approach. In some cases, brute force is fine if followed by the successful design of a more efficient algorithm
Correctly estimate the time complexity of all the options
Write clean code with verbose variable names, no nesting, or numerous edge cases/flags.
Decompose the problem into functions/types - no duplicate code
Preserve test cases for future use
